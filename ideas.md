# Ideas

My current plans to develop this library include the following, but please feel free to add any suggestions.

- Creating a class that can filter out all of the "filler" words and terms from the string that contains the HTML content of the webpage (think "and," "a," "the," etc.)
- Developing an algorithm that can identify and sort the important terms, such as names, phrases, and places

Possible Ideas:
- Automatically retrieve references, such as Wikipedia articles, about identified key words.
- Retrieve sentences/phrases in which certain words were used
- Use open source plagiarism checkers, such as [Sherlock](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/ias/software/sherlock/), to compare articles.
- Create tags of the article using frequently used words
