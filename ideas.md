# Ideas

My current plans to develop this library include the following, but please feel free to add any suggestions.

- Creating a class that can filter out all of the "filler" words and terms from the string that contains the HTML content of the webpage (think "and," "a," "the," etc.)
- Developing an algorithm that can identify and sort the important terms, such as names, phrases, and places
